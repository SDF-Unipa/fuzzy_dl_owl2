# Installation and Configuration

```python
pip install fuzzy-dl-owl2
```

Examples of supported Fuzzy Description Logic Constructs

| Python Class         | Description                       |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| AtomicConcept        | Define an atomic concept          |
| ChoquetIntegral      | Define a choquet integral concept |
| ApproximationConcept | Define a tight/upper/* lower/upper approximation concept |

## Configuration of the MILP solver

Since version 1.0.1 uses `Gurobi Optimizer` (see [gurobipy](https://support.gurobi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044290292-How-do-I-install-Gurobi-for-Python) for the Fuzzy DL reasoning, please create a GUROBI license to use this library.

For the configuration, create a `CONFIG.ini` file in the same directory used for the execution of the library.
Example of your execution directory:
```text
your_directory
├── CONFIG.ini
├── your_file.py
```

The file `CONFIG.ini` is structured as follows:
```text
[DEFAULT]
debugPrint = False
epsilon = 0.001
maxIndividuals = -1
owlAnnotationLabel = fuzzyLabel
milpProvider = mip
```

| Configuration Variable | Description                       |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| debugPrint        | Enable/disable debugging          |
| epsilon | Define the precision of the solution. For instance, epsilon = 0.001 means that the solution will be calculated with an accuracy to the third decimal place |
| maxIndividuals | Define the maximal number of individuals to handle. The value $-1$ indicates that there is no maximum |
| owlAnnotationLabel | Define the Annotation label used to build the Fuzzy OWL 2 RDF/XML ontology |
| milpProvider | Define the MILP provider used by the reasoner. The supported providers are listed below. |

Supported MILP Providers:
| Provider | milpProvider |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Gurobi | gurobi |
| CPLEX | pulp_cplex |
| CBC | pulp |
| GLPK | pulp_glpk |
| HiGHS | pulp_highs |
| MIP | mip |
